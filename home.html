            <h1>Our Trip to Peru</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>During August of 2022, my girlfriend, Karsyn, and I took a two week vacation to Peru. This trip had been on our
                bucket list for a long time, and we were fortunate to both be able to take the necessary time off of work in
                order to make it happen. There is so much to see and do in Peru that one could stay there for years and still
                find new and exciting things. But since we only had two weeks, we spent most of our trip in three places: Cusco, Iquitos, and Huaraz.

            <h2>Cusco</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>The First Day</h3>
                    <p>Cusco was our first stop, and is arguably the most well known city in Peru. Cusco is the launching point
                        for many of the most scenic treks in all of Peru, including Rainbow Mountain, and of course, Machu Picchu.
                        Unfortunately, my checked bag was lost en route to Cusco, so when we showed up to our hotel, the only items
                        in my possession were the clothes I had on my back. Good thing I brought a jacket on the plane! Luckily,
                        there are plenty of outdoor equipment shops in the town square due to Cusco’s popularity as a launching point
                        for various backpacking trips. We spent the entire first day getting adjusted to the altitude (11,100 feet
                        above sea level) and replacing my lost equipment. Fortunately, I was able to replace most of the items in my
                        lost bag by the end of the day. </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
                    <p>The next day, we started on our first trek: Machu Picchu via Salkantay Pass. The guide picked us up from our
                        hotel at 2 AM and we drove nearly four hours to the start of the hike. After a quick breakfast, we set out
                        on our adventure around 6 AM. We immediately set out for Salkantay Pass, but as we started to climb the
                        mountain, Karsyn began to feel sick from the altitude. As we got closer to the top, the weather started to
                        sour on us, and thick clouds blocked the stunning views of the surrounding mountains. When we finally
                        reached the top (15,190 feet), it began to snow. We quickly hurried down the mountain in order to reach our
                        lunch spot and get out of the snow, and as we dropped in altitude, the weather changed dramatically. By the
                        time we reached our lunch spot, we were in a tropical rainforest. After lunch, we hiked for a few more hours,
                        until we reached our rest spot for the night: the Andean Huts. The next day was less eventful. We hiked for a
                        while in the morning before having lunch at a coffee plantation where the hosts showed us the process for
                        converting the raw coffee beans into the beans you might buy at the store. We even had the chance to grind some
                        of the beans ourselves! After this, we hiked for the rest of the day along a railroad track until we reached the
                        town of Aguas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu. On our third day, we toured Machu Picchu. We woke up early,
                        at about 4:30 AM to hop on a bus up to the top of Machu Picchu. Although it was so cloudy when we first arrived
                        that we couldn’t even see the mountain, the weather eventually cleared up around mid morning and we were able to
                        take some good pictures and see the picturesque view from the top of the mountain. We also had the opportunity
                        to tour Huchu Picchu, the smaller of the two mountains behind the city. After returning to Aguas Calientes, we
                        had lunch and I tried guinea pig, a popular local cuisine, for the first time (not sure I would recommend it
                        again though!). In the afternoon, we returned to Cusco.</p>

                    <h3>Rainbow Mountain</h3>
                    <p>The following day, we went on a guided tour to Rainbow Mountain. Our guide picked us up at 4:30 AM, and we stopped
                        for a quick buffet breakfast around 7 AM before heading to the mountain. Even arriving that early, the place was already
                        crowded. Our guide took us up a lesser known route to the top of the mountain and we were able to get some incredible
                        pictures of the mountain while avoiding the worst of the crowds. At the top of the mountain, some local Peruvians with
                        llamas charged a small fee to take pictures of Rainbow Mountain with the llamas. Money well spent if you ask me! After
                        seeing Rainbow Mountain, our guide showed us another valley, with mountains dyed red similar to what you might see in
                        Arizona and the Grand Canyon. We stopped at the same buffet on the way back to Cusco for a late lunch and then prepared
                        for our next stage of the trip.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Iquitos and the Amazon</h2>

            </div>

            <div>
                <p>After spending the first few days in Cusco, we flew to Iquitos, a  remote city located on the banks of the Amazon River. The
                    place that we had arranged to stay at, Tahuayo Lodge, was located deep within the Amazon Rainforest and required us to take a
                    three hour boat ride from Iquitos. So when we arrived in Iquitos, we headed straight to the dock, where we boarded the boat that
                    would take us to the lodge. About an hour or so into the boat ride, our guide stopped the boat and told us to be on the lookout
                    for pink dolphins. At first, I thought he was pulling our leg, but a few seconds later, we saw a splash in the water. Then, another,
                    and another after that. Sure enough, a pod of dolphins was swimming past us, some gray, but many of them pink. After a couple more
                    hours on the boat, we arrived at the lodge. Tahuayo lodge is a massive wooden structure built on large stilts, with platforms and
                    buildings connected by wooden walkways. The stilts, we later learned, are crucial during flooding season, where the water levels rise
                    by as much as twelve feet and often engulf much of the land on the banks of the river. Over the next few days, we had the opportunity
                    to explore much of the surrounding wildlife and take in the natural beauty of the rainforest. Over the course of our stay, we saw a
                    plethora of animals, plants, and insects, including poison dart frogs, snakes, rare birds, caymans (similar to alligators), opossums,
                    spiders, monkeys, and many more. One of the highlights of our time in the Amazon was going fishing for piranhas. Because they are so
                    agressive, you agressively stir the water in order to attract them. Karsyn was able to catch one and we even had the chance to try
                    piranha! Additionally, we had the opportunity to take a zipline tour through the canopy of the rainforest. From the top of the trees,
                    we saw large swaths of forest, as well as birds and monkeys moving through the treetops. Throughout our time at Tahuayo Lodge, the
                    food was consistently excellent. The chefs served mostly traditional Peruvian food, with an abundance of fresh fruit, and we certainly
                    never went hungry. After our time in the Amazon, we took the boat back to Iquitos, and flew back to Lima, where we took a night bus to
                    our final destination: Huaraz.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="h2">Huaraz</h2>

            <div>
                <p> We spent the final leg of our trip in Huaraz, a mountain town a few hours north of Lima. We arrived at 6:30 AM after taking the night
                    bus, and the change in altitude, after spending the last few days at sea level in the Amazon, was apparent. We spent the first day
                    in Huaraz acclimatizing, taking a long breakfast at a cafe in the town center before lounging at our hostel for most of the afternoon.
                    However, the next morning, we set out on our final multi-day trek: the Huayhuash Circuit. The Huayhuash Circuit is a famous trek
                    through the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in Peru, that typically takes about ten days while leading hikers through stunning views
                    of mountains, lakes, and the surrounding terrain. Unfortunately, due to our limited PTO, we had to settle for a “mini Huayhuash tour”
                    that would take us through a small portion of the main circuit. Because the altitude was so high, we did very little hiking on the
                    first day. We drove for a few hours and almost immediately set up camp, giving us the chance to acclimatize for an extra day. The next
                    day though, was a long one. We hiked nearly all day up through a mountain pass, before descending down into a valley with beautiful
                    rivers running through it. From where we camped, the entire valley sprawled out in front of us, with the mountains towering majestically
                    in the background. It was one of the most beautiful sights I have seen in my life and possibly the highlight of the trip. The next day,
                    we headed back to Huaraz, and booked a day trip to Laguna 69 for our last full day in Peru. The following morning, we waited outside our
                    hostel at 4:30 AM, where a bus picked us up along with about 30 other people and drove to the trailhead for Laguna 69. The hike itself
                    was grueling, and the altitude made it even tougher, but views at the lagoon were worth every bit of effort spent to get there. After a
                    much easier hike back down and a bus ride back to Huaraz, we cooked a quick dinner before taking an overnight taxi back to Lima. When we
                    arrived at the Lima airport the next morning, we flew back home to the United States.</p>
