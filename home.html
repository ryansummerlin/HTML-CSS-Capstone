            <h1>Our Trip to Peru</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>During August of 2022, my girlfriend, Karsyn, and I took a two week vacation to Peru. This trip had been on our
                bucket list for a long time, and we were fortunate to both be able to take the necessary time off of work in
                order to make it happen. There is so much to see and do in Peru that one could stay there for years and still
                find new and exciting things. But since we only had two weeks, we spent most of our trip in three places: Cusco, Iquitos, and Huaraz.</p>

                    <h3>The First Day</h3>
                    <p>Cusco was our first stop, and is arguably the most well known city in Peru. Cusco is the launching point
                        for many of the most scenic treks in all of Peru, including Rainbow Mountain, and of course, Machu Picchu.
                        Unfortunately, my checked bag was lost en route to Cusco, so when we showed up to our hotel, the only items
                        in my possession were the clothes I had on my back. Good thing I brought a jacket on the plane! Luckily,
                        there are plenty of outdoor equipment shops in the town square due to Cusco’s popularity as a launching point
                        for various backpacking trips. We spent the entire first day getting adjusted to the altitude (11,100 feet
                        above sea level) and replacing my lost equipment. Fortunately, I was able to replace most of the items in my
                        lost bag by the end of the day. </p>

                    <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
                    <p>The next day, we started on our first trek: Machu Picchu via Salkantay Pass. The guide picked us up from our
                        hotel at 2 AM and we drove nearly four hours to the start of the hike. After a quick breakfast, we set out
                        on our adventure around 6 AM. We immediately set out for Salkantay Pass, but as we started to climb the
                        mountain, Karsyn began to feel sick from the altitude. As we got closer to the top, the weather started to
                        sour on us, and thick clouds blocked the stunning views of the surrounding mountains. When we finally
                        reached the top (15,190 feet), it began to snow. We quickly hurried down the mountain in order to reach our
                        lunch spot and get out of the snow, and as we dropped in altitude, the weather changed dramatically. By the
                        time we reached our lunch spot, we were in a tropical rainforest. After lunch, we hiked for a few more hours,
                        until we reached our rest spot for the night: the Andean Huts. The next day was less eventful. We hiked for a
                        while in the morning before having lunch at a coffee plantation where the hosts showed us the process for
                        converting the raw coffee beans into the beans you might buy at the store. We even had the chance to grind some
                        of the beans ourselves! After this, we hiked for the rest of the day along a railroad track until we reached the
                        town of Aguas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu. On our third day, we toured Machu Picchu. We woke up early,
                        at about 4:30 AM to hop on a bus up to the top of Machu Picchu. Although it was so cloudy when we first arrived
                        that we couldn’t even see the mountain, the weather eventually cleared up around mid morning and we were able to
                        take some good pictures and see the picturesque view from the top of the mountain. We also had the opportunity
                        to tour Huchu Picchu, the smaller of the two mountains behind the city. After returning to Aguas Calientes, we
                        had lunch and I tried guinea pig, a popular local cuisine, for the first time (not sure I would recommend it
                        again though!). In the afternoon, we returned to Cusco.</p>

                    <h3>Rainbow Mountain</h3>
                    <p>The following day, we went on a guided tour to Rainbow Mountain. Our guide picked us up at 4:30 AM, and we stopped
                        for a quick buffet breakfast around 7 AM before heading to the mountain. Even arriving that early, the place was already
                        crowded. Our guide took us up a lesser known route to the top of the mountain and we were able to get some incredible
                        pictures of the mountain while avoiding the worst of the crowds. At the top of the mountain, some local Peruvians with
                        llamas charged a small fee to take pictures of Rainbow Mountain with the llamas. Money well spent if you ask me! After
                        seeing Rainbow Mountain, our guide showed us another valley, with mountains dyed red similar to what you might see in
                        Arizona and the Grand Canyon. We stopped at the same buffet on the way back to Cusco for a late lunch and then prepared
                        for our next stage of the trip.</p>
